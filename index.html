      <p>
        My name is Myrthe Dullaart. I'm 27 years old and I'm from the Netherlands. I have a bachelors degree in Biology but my real passion is coding. In my bachelor time I had to use quite some R for statistical analyses. I always really enjoyed the writting code aspect of this. After finishing my bachelors I decided to look more into coding. I first started with trying to dable in it a bit myself with Javascript through Code Academy. I very much enjoyed this so I decided to persue coding more seriously and learn as much as possible through Boolean.

        <h4>Gymnastics</h4>
        <p>For my second Boolean assignment I had to recreate the front page of a gymnastics website. For this assignment I had to use a lot more CSS. I learned how to use blocks and how to use margin and padding. I also changed things like colours, font and learned how to put borders around the blocks. </p>
